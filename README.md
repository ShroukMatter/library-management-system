# Library Management System

A simple console-based library management system implemented in C#.

## Description

This project is a console-based library management system that allows users to perform various operations such as adding books, removing books, finding books, renting books, checking book availability, and displaying all books.

## Features

- *Add a book:* Users can add a new book to the library inventory.
- *Remove a book:* Users can remove a book from the library inventory.
- *Find a book:* Users can search for a book by its title.
- *Rent a book:* Users can rent a book from the library inventory.
- *Show books:* Users can view all the books available in the library inventory.
- *Check book availability:* Users can check if a book is available for rent.

## Notes
I have added a Rent a Book section so we can use Check book availability later.
